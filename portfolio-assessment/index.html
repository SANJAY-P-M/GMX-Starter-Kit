                &emsp; &emsp;I'am SANJAY P M speaking frankly about my character. Love to explore new things and make new connections . I believe <em>"Hearing advice is good thing but following it blindly without self evaluating is a bad thing."</em> The reason I choose Computer Science Department is that I think 'There will a new things daily to learn everyday and I think it will be more interesting' . As per the expectation , It is a great department to make our knowledge sharper and seriously It won't be boring XD.

                    Acquiring knowledge about every branch of engineering is quite good in First year.  We secured second place in <em><a href="https://yugam.in/event/4/detail/">Circuit Debugging</a></em> with Rs.2000 cash prize. <em><a href="https://yugam.in/">Yygam 2022</a></em> is the biggest event held at coimbatore . Still this event is apart from my department but this subject will be more interesting to learn . I think every department in engineering has an equal important.

                    Hands on practice with arduino board . Gives a basic knowledge about microcontroler , motors , sensors and autonomous vehicle. I think it is most essential subject to learn at first . I got it from  <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/sri-shakthi-institute-of-engineering-&-technology/">Sri shakthi institute of engineering</a></em> :) .
